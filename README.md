# AlarmClock

##

This project is about an alarm clock that plays a light animation during its alarm state. Once the alarm state is triggered, the LEDs will transition into a new light animation, play a continuous beep, and utilizes a solenoid to push out a part of the prototype enclosure out of its nesting space. The only way to successfully disarm the alarm beep is to place the missing component back into its enclosure which will then read a photoresistor to successfully disable the pushing solenoid and alarm beep.
